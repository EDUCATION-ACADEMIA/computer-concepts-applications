<title>IVY Consulting Group is a leading management, information and technology consultancy, operating worldwide from thirty-five offices. It was started in North America more than thirty years ago. The company took over a consulting group in Australia eighteen months ago and a consulting group with offices in Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan six months ago. IVY draws on the knowledge and expertise of 2000 employees, whose skills span a wider range of capability than any other major consulting firm. Its consultancy services-strategy, performance improvement, IT, technology, human resources, recruitment, program and project management-are helping its clients to transform their businesses in order to achieve significant increases in value, profitability and effectiveness. Recently IVY re-examined its business processes and found that its offices and service groups did not communicate as well as they could. Expertise was not being used to the fullest to create a competitive advantage. Many opportunities for new clients were being lost or simply overlooked. Some existing clients were changing to other organisations to meet their consultancy needs. The success of the consultancy is based on being able to provide total business solutions on a global basis, regardless of the country. Historically, parts of the IVY Group had been insular because they were geographically distant. Now with the acquisition of the Australian group and the group in Asia matters have become worse. The offices in each group based in Australia, Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong has particular type of organisational culture and sharing of information and resources are proving problematic. The aim now is to come together globally and share not just best practice but also common and standard practice through the firm. For example, IVY built up methodologies over many years, but they need to be shared. There is a real need to integrate these systems and set some standards for the organisation as a whole. Overall, the IT problems and the information and knowledge management problems reflect the problems associated with integrating the newly merged companies as one entity. The companys board realises that strategic thinking is required in relation to IT.These are some reasons why IVY Consulting should understand the concept of Global Economy and its importance to eCommerce enterprises, except.
